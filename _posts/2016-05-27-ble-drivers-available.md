Today we have released the first complete version of drivers for Bluetooth Low Energy devices. In particular we released the generic Bluetooth Low Energy network driver, which enables communication with BLE devices, and a set of drivers for the Texas Instruments CC2650 Sensor Tag.
Support to BLE is built on top of the wonderful TinyB Bluetooth library.

Support to Bluetooth notification is still missing as it is currently not supported (but planned) by TinyB.  

Stay tuned and let us know if you experience problems or if you have suggestions!

Have fun!
