Today we have released the first complete version of [drivers](https://github.com/dog-gateway/bluetooth-drivers) for Bluetooth Low Energy devices. In particular we released the generic Bluetooth Low Energy network driver, which enables communication with BLE devices, and a set of drivers for the [Texas Instruments CC2650 Sensor Tag](http://www.ti.com/tool/cc2650stk).
Support to BLE is built on top of the wonderful [TinyB](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/tinyb) Bluetooth library.

Support to Bluetooth notification is still missing as it is currently not supported (but planned) by TinyB.  

Check new drivers at: [https://github.com/dog-gateway/bluetooth-drivers](https://github.com/dog-gateway/bluetooth-drivers)

Stay tuned and let us know if you experience problems or if you have suggestions!

Have fun!
