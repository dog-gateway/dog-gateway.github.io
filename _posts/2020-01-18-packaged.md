Today we released the firsts versions of Dog DEBIAN packages. These packages include a minimal, yet working version of Dog incorporating EnOcean drivers. They have been tested primarily on Raspbian (Buster and earlier), however they should run on Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian Buster with almost no issue.

Meanwhile, we also updated the stand-alone skeleton for packaging a Dog distribution from scratch. This last version of the stand-alone skeleton is aligned to the one used in packaged versions.

Stay tuned and please contact us for any issue / bug / problem you might notice.
