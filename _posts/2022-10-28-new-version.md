Today we released the 3.5.8 version of Dog, aligned to the latest release of the Eclipse Equinox framework (3.18.100).
Such a new version includes the following major changes:

* update to Jetty 10.0.12 
* support for Java-17

The corresponding DEBIAN package is now available on this site and includes a minimal, 
yet working version of Dog incorporating EnOcean and Modbus drivers. 
It has been tested primarily on Raspbian (Bullseye and earlier), 
however it should run on Ubuntu and Debian Bullseye with almost no issue.

Stay tuned and please contact us for any issue / bug / problem you might notice.
