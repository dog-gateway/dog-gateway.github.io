Today we release a relevant update of the core library which brings Dog in-line with the latest DogOnt v4.0 ontology. Such an update 
includes some strong re-factoring of class trees related to device models and in particular includes the complete removal of all *System
classes. Moreover support to additional devices is provided, extending the set set of supported devices beyond the usual set of home automation devices.

Together with the core library update we also release some minor updates on drivers to fix small issues generated by the above described 
library update.

Stay tuned and please contact us for any issue / bug / problem you might notice.
