We added support for quadruple sensors (temperature, humidity, lighting and movement) in the core-library. The new device, named QuadSensor, can now be exploited in every technology given that a suitable driver will be developed.

A reference implementation for ZWave has also been posted on GitHub, demonstrating how to support the new device, and it has been tested using the [Aeon Labs Multiple Sensor](http://aeotec.com/z-wave-sensor).

Stay tuned for further updates!
