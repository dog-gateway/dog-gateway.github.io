We are sponsoring the "[*Ambient Intelligence: Technologies and Design*](http://bit.ly/polito-ami)" course (2014 edition) taught at Politecnico di Torino in the Spring session. 

In such a context we provide three Dog installations respectively connected to:

* a ZWave network including 5 metered plugs and 3 quadruple sensors
* a ZigBee network including 10 metered plugs, 3 movement sensors, 3 temperature and humidity sensors, and many other devices kindly provided by the [Energy@Home](http://www.energy-home.it) consortium through Telecom Italia Lab, to sponsor the course
* a BTicino Myhome network including a MyHome SDK case kindly provided by [BTicino](http://www.bticino.com/) to sponsor the course
* a [Philips HUE](http://meethue.com/) bridge with 3 lamps and one lightstrip

The resulting test bench is shown below, and includes 3 Raspberry Pi running Dog, the Philips HUE bridge, 1 Ethernet switch and 1 wireless access point.
