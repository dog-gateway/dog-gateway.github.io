Today we release the first, yet uncomplete, version of the EnOcean device drivers for Dog. Currently supported devices include RockerSwitches (F50201,F50202) and Temperature Sensors (A502XX). Further support is planned to be added in the next days. The driver structure respects the general Dog development guidelines that allows defining new device-specific drivers in a very simple manner.

Check out the new EnOcean drivers on GitHub and, if you want more devices to be supported, please submit your desires as a comment or issue, or your contribution as a pull-request:

* [EnOcean drivers](https://github.com/dog-gateway/enocean-drivers)
* [EnOcean configuration](https://github.com/dog-gateway/enocean-configuration)

Have fun and let us know if something is broken!

*We wish to thank [NodOn&copy;](http://www.nodon.fr) for supporting the development of this drivers by donating free samples of their EnOcean devices.*
