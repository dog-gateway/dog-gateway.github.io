Today we release the first, yet uncomplete, version of the EnOcean Java Library. Stemming from a Master Thesis work of almost one year ago (thanks to Andrea Biasi), the library offers simple access to EnOcean networks through gateway devices.
It can be exploited both as standalone library or as an OSGi bundle. More information is provided in the library README file.

Check out EnJ on github:

* [EnJ-library](https://github.com/dog-gateway/enj-library)

Have fun and let us know if something is broken!

*We wish to thank [NodOn&copy;](http://www.nodon.fr) for supporting the development of this library by donating free samples of their EnOcean devices.*
