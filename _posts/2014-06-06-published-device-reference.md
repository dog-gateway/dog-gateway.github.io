The complete device reference, to be used as complimentary material for the RestAPI documentation, has been published at [http://dog-gateway.github.io/device-documentation.html](/device-documentation.html). 

For each device supported by the dog gateway, the reference reports the set of available commands, with the relative parameters, the set of notifications generated by devices (and dispatched through the upcoming WebSocketAPI), and the set of states in which devices can be.
