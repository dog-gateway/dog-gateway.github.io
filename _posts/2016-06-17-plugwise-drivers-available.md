Today we have released the first complete version of [drivers](https://github.com/dog-gateway/plugwise-over-mqtt-drivers) for Plugwise Circle devices. Support to Plugwise devices is based upon the [Plugwise-2-py](https://github.com/SevenW/Plugwise-2-py) library and consumes data delivery over MQTT thanks to the Dog MQTT library. 

Check new drivers at: [https://github.com/dog-gateway/plugwise-over-mqtt-drivers](https://github.com/dog-gateway/plugwise-over-mqtt-drivers)

Stay tuned and let us know if you experience problems or if you have suggestions!

Have fun!
