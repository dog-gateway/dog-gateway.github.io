In the last year the MQTT telemetry protocol emerged as a standard de-facto for light-weight communication in the Internet Of Things. 
Such a technology allows asynchronous, reliable (when needed) broker-centric communication permitting data to seamlessly cross LAN boundaries to be shared in a global ecosystem of connected objects. 
Today, the Dog Gateway offers support to delivery device statuses and notifications through MQTT. Flexibility is the main goal of such a new deployment, this is reflect on:

* the ability to publish data to multiple MQTT brokers at the same time
* the ability to use different translation mechanisms for each broker (and even for notification and device states)
* the ability to use "custom" translation engines published as OSGi services.

If you are eager to experiment with such a new feature, please check out the Dog MqttBridge bundles at the following addresses:
