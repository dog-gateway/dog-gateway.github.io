Today we released the official update to Modbus drivers, which includes a completely different approach to register translation, supporting many of the Modbus register variants that can be encountered in real-life. Moreover, several bug fixes have been introduced (after field-testing) to enable a more robust handling of Modbus communication (and configuration) errors. The released update is 100% backward compatible with previous releases. 

Stay tuned and please contact us for any issue / bug / problem you might notice.
