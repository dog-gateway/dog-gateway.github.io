Stemming from the thesis work of [Teodoro Montanaro](http://www.rosario49.it/teodoro_montanaro/) (thanks, Teo!), today we unveil the **Dog WebSocket API**.

Such an API allows bi-directional communication between Dog and a client application, building upon the REST API and extending it with the introduction of device **notifications** handling.

Checkout the corresponding [documentation](/websocket-api.html), the relative OSGi bundles from GitHub:

* [WebSocket Connector](https://github.com/dog-gateway/websocket-connector)
* [WebSocket Device API](https://github.com/dog-gateway/websocket-device-api)
* [WebSocket Environment API](https://github.com/dog-gateway/websocket-environment-api)
* [WebSocket Dependencies](https://github.com/dog-gateway/websocket-dependencies)

and an example configuration: [WebSocket Configuration](https://github.com/dog-gateway/websocket-configuration).

Have fun and let us know if something is broken!
