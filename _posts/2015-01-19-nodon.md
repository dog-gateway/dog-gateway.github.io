Today, the EnOcean devices kindly provided by NodOn® finally arrived. Here we report the first impressions on such devices and provide some photos of the unpacking process.

As any technical guy would, we were quite eager to get the devices in our hands and to start experimenting with them. At the first impression everything in NodOn® solutions is carefully designed, starting from the "environment friendly" paper boxes and going to device aestetics and documentation. 
Devices appear well packed, enclosures are not really fancy but effective and well designed, and they seem quite robust and dependable (for what can be achieved with a plastic casing). For those eager to see more, here you can find a picture of the whole set of devices kindly donated by NodOn®.

<h3>Soft Remote</h3>
<p class="text-justify"><img src="/assets/img/pictures/nodon/soft_remote_small.jpg" alt="The NodOn® soft remote." class="pull-left"/> The Soft Remote device is a rubber coated rocker switch featuring a back magnet for easily hanging it wherever at hand, e.g. on the fridge. It feels quite comfortable at touch although the force required  for activating buttons is quite sensible. This, however, cannot be considered a shortcoming as the button pressing force is used as energy source to generate radio signals, meaning that the remote is completely battery-less.</p>

<h3>Wall Switch </h3>
<p class="text-justify"><img src="/assets/img/pictures/nodon/wall_switch_small.jpg" alt="The NodOn® wall-switch." class="pull-left"/> The Wall Switch employs the same underlying rocker switch technology, but cased into a more "traditional" wall switch shape. It features 2 sets of interchangeable buttons enabling its use as either a single or double switch.</p>

<h3>Door Sensor</h3><p class="text-justify"><img src="/assets/img/pictures/nodon/door_sensor_small.jpg" alt="The NodOn® door sensor." class="pull-left"/> The door sensor features a small solar panel which allows the device to harvest the energy needed for everyday operation. Night-time and poor-lighting scenarios are supported through a battery supply. Differently from the remote control, the EnOcean Equipment Profiles supported by this device can be easily discovered by looking under the back cover, near to the learn button.</p>

<h3>Temperature Sensor</h3>
<p class="text-justify"><img src="/assets/img/pictures/nodon/temperature_sensor_small.jpg" alt="The NodOn® temperature sensor." class="pull-left"/> The temperature sensor features a small solar panel which allows the device to harvest the energy needed for everyday operation. Night-time and poor-lighting scenarios are supported through a battery supply. Differently from the remote control, the EnOcean Equipment Profiles supported by this device (A5-02-05) can be easily discovered by looking under the back cover, near to the learn button.</p>

Next posts will employ the soft remote control in a very first and hacking-style integration with Dog.
