Today we published the first, still experimental, version of the Dog drivers for the Philips Hue lamps and devices. The drivers support bridge discovery and push link authentication, and can automatically discover, and interface lamps and led strips connected to any reachable Hue Bridge. More than one bridge at time can be interfaced.

Checkout the OSGi bundles from GitHub:

* [Hue Drivers](https://github.com/dog-gateway/hue-drivers)
* [Example configuration](https://github.com/dog-gateway/hue-configuration)

If you do not own a Hue bridge and you still want to experiment with the Hue drivers, you could checkout the [Hue Emulator](https://github.com/SteveyO/Hue-Emulator) on GitHub.

Have fun and let us know if something is broken!
