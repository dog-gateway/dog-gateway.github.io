Today we release a draft version of the Virtualappliances bundle of Dog. This bundle permits to emulate the states of complex devices (appliances) given consumption measurements coming from a selected power meter. Virtual appliances are made available to the platform, and to external applications, in exactly the same manner of real devices.

However, it must be noted that support to virtual appliances is still experimental: bugs may appear and changes are expected in the next releases.

Check out the new Virtualappliances bundle on GitHub and, if you want more devices to be supported, please submit your desires as a comment or issue, or your contribution as a pull-request:

* [Virtualappliances](https://github.com/dog-gateway/virtualappliances)
* [Virtualappliances configuration](https://github.com/dog-gateway/virtualappliances-configuration)
* [Virtualappliances dependencies](https://github.com/dog-gateway/virtualappliances-dependencies)

Have fun and let us know if something is broken!
