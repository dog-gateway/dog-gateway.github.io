The last months were quite interesting for the Dog gateway. Today we just released an updated version of ZWave drivers able to connect to multiple RazBerry gateways, concurrently. Moreover, we are steadily working on updating and extending support to Modbus including RTU over serial connections, device blacklisting for better handling failing devices, etc.
We have started working on adding auto-discovery to ZWave drivers to enable automatic discovery of devices already associated to a pre-existing ZWave network. More features and updates are expected including:
* Addons to deliver data to ThingSpeak
* Upgrade of Bluetooth drivers to support device notifications
* etc.

Have fun, and please contact us if you encounter any problems or bugs.
