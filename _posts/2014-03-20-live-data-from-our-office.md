We just added a new "Demo" section where data measured by the Dog gateway running in our lab is published. The page (that can be forked on GitHub) exploits the [Xively.js](http://xively.github.io/xively-js/) API to fetch measures posted by the gateway on Xively. 

We are planning to further improve this on-line demo by providing access to a real installation via the Dog REST APIs thus enabling developers to test their own applications without having to install the gateway locally. 

Actions on devices will be visible through video-streaming (we are still investigating which solution to adopt, any suggestion is welcomed).
