Z-Wave drivers have been patched to permit association of multiple Dog devices to single real device. This is particularly useful to enable early adoption of currently unsupported devices.

In the upcoming weeks a new patch is foreseen to support latest ZWay versions, which require basic authentication for getting device data.

Stay tuned and let us know if you experience problems or if you have suggestions!

Have fun!
