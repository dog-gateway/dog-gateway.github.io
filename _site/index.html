          <p>The Dog gateway (formerly known as Domotic OSGi Gateway) is a software gateway offering a single, uniform, transparent, rest-based access to a variety of home and building automation devices (and protocols). While several alternatives could be found offering apparently similar services, The Dog gateway offers unprecedented
abstraction capability by exploiting a sound, consistent and validated model based on description logic (i.e., the DogOnt ontology).</p>

<h4>Why device abstraction?</h4>

<ul>
<li>To decouple application development (web, desktop, mobile or cloud) from single technologies and related peculiarities, idiosynchrasies, and issues.</li>
<li>To enable application-level inter-operation of different technologies, devices, and automation networks.</li>
<li>To enable developers to only concentrate on control logic, which can be defined <em>once</em> and deployed <em>wherever</em>  needed, delegating the &quot;network stuff&quot; to the gateway.</li>
<li>To enable advanced, semantic-based, solutions for home and building automation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Which technologies are supported?</h4>

<p>The Dog gateway can virtually support any home, building and automation protocol. It currently offers support for a relatively wide range of networks, including bus-technologies, wireless-systems and typical industrial automation solutions. In particular, supported protocols include:</p>

<h5>Bus technologies</h5>

<ul>
<li>KNX</li>
<li>MyHome (BTicino)</li>
<li>Echelon (through the ILON100 gateway)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Wireless Technologies</h5>

<ul>
<li>ZWave </li>
<li>ZigBee</li>
<li>EnOcean (currently under development)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Industrial automation</h5>

<ul>
<li>Modbus (TCP, RTU, RTU over TCP)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Other technologies</h5>

<ul>
<li>Smart Watch - Texas Instruments TIxxx</li>
<li>Philips HUE (currently under development)</li>
</ul>

<h4>How much does it costs?</h4>

<p><strong>Nothing</strong>: it is an Open Source software released under the Apache v2.0 License. However if you really like our software, you can provide funding for next developments, in any form you prefer. </p>

<h4>If I&#39;m not an hacking guy?</h4>

<ul>
<li>You can buy a pre-installed 8Gbyte SD card for your RaspberryPi for just  16 Euro.</li>
<li>You can buy our hardware, namely &quot;The Orb&quot;, with Dog and ZWave pre-installed. (You can also require other technologies when ordering).</li>
</ul>
