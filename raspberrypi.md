## Running Dog on Raspberry Pi ##

The Dog Gateway can run on any hardware platform hosting a Java Virtual Machine. 

Among the available platforms, the [Raspberry Pi&copy;](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is our preferred solution for low-cost, high-performance deployments.

We currently test Dog releases on the Pi and we release some pre-compiled images for newbies to start experimenting with the Dog Gateway, with almost no installation effort. 

Pre-compiled (raw) images are based on the official [Raspbian OS](http://www.raspbian.org/) and integrate Dog as service. Currently only Z-Wave solutions are provided, based on the [RaZBerry](http://razberry.z-wave.me/) module. In a near future we envision to distribute images also for ZigBee and EnOcean networks.

Image installation follows almost the same procedure indicated in the [Raspberry Pi Wiki](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup), except that the starting raw image must be downloaded from here.
