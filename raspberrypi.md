## Running Dog on Raspberry Pi ##

The Dog Gateway can run on any hardware platform hosting a Java Virtual Machine. 

Among the available platforms, the [Raspberry Pi&copy;](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is our preferred solution for low-cost, high-performance deployments.

We currently test Dog releases on the Pi with the official [Raspbian OS](http://www.raspbian.org/). Z-Wave solutions for Raspberry Pi are based on the [RaZBerry](http://razberry.z-wave.me/) module.

To install Dog, please follow the same procedure indicated in the [Raspberry Pi Wiki](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup) for preparing your Raspberry Pi system. Then, add Dog as reported in the traditional [setup](/useit.html).
